# 🎮 How to Play Adventure Buds

Welcome to **Adventure Buds – The Eternal Quest**! This is a cooperative journey where your success depends on how well you and your partner work together.

## 🕹️ Controls (Mobile / Local Co-op)
The game is designed for two players on a single device or screen.

*   **Movement**: Use the **Joypads** on the bottom left (Player 1) and bottom right (Player 2).
*   **Compliment Combo**: Tap the **Heart Button (❤️)** near your joypad. If both players press it at the exact same time, you trigger a powerful burst of love!

## ✨ Core Mechanics

### 🤝 The Harmony Engine
Your **Harmony Meter** (the glowing bar at the top) is the heart of the game.
*   **Sync Up**: Stay close to your partner to increase Harmony.
*   **Buffs**: High Harmony makes both players move faster.
*   **Soul Link**: At 100% Harmony, your souls link visually, and you move with maximum grace.

### ⏳ Quality Time
Time is your most precious resource. 
*   The timer at the top shows your remaining **Quality Time**.
*   It depletes as you play. If it reaches zero, the quest ends!
*   **Safe Zones (Benches)**: Find benches in the level. If both players stand near a bench for 5 seconds, you'll "Rest and Talk," replenishing your Quality Time.

### 📈 Shared Growth
You are in this together!
*   **XP**: Every item gathered and every challenge completed gives you shared XP.
*   **Leveling**: When you gain enough XP, you both level up, unlocking the potential for future buffs.

## 🍵 Level 1: The Creamy Chai Shop
Your goal is to brew the "First Date" potion.

1.  **Gather Ingredients**: Find **Tea Leaves (🌿)** and **Pearls (⚪)** scattered around the shop.
2.  **The Sip-Off**: Step onto the orange platform near the counter to trigger a mini-game. Rapidly tap your **SIP!** button to finish your drink before your partner—but be careful! Sipping too fast causes a **Brain Freeze (🧊)**, stopping you for a few seconds.

*Remember: There are no misunderstandings, only shared adventures.*
